## Teams

`Teams` are a way to easily manage groups of users for the purposes of project access, communication, and challenge participation. In this guide you will learn how to:

* Create and manage teams
* Find teams, and identify and manage the teams to which you belong
* Use teams for communications and project permissions
* Submit to a challenge as a team

### Creating a Team

From your Profile Page, which can be accessed by clicking your name in the top right corner, click on the **Teams** tab as seen below.

Enter a team name in the dialog box and click **Create Team**. If the team name already exists, you will be prompted to enter a new team name.

Once the `Team` in created, you will be taken to the team page, where you can invite members, change settings, edit or delete the team. By default, the user creating the team is the Team Manager, the user with permissions to perform these changes. The Team Manager may designate additional Team Managers by changing the setting next to the userâ€™s name.

### Managing a Team

For `Teams` for which you are a Team Manager, you may invite or delete team members and edit team settings, from the team page. Under the Tools button in the upper right corner of the page you will see options to 
Invite Users: find and invite registered Synapse users to join your `Team`. Users will be sent an email indicating they have been invited to join the `Team` and must confirm the invitation prior to being included.

* Edit Team: edit the team name, description and icon, and change settings allowing users to join the team without Manger permission or allow non-members to email the team
* Delete Team: delete all references to the team
* Leave Team: this option is available to any team member who wants to be removed from a team 

You may also remove team members by clicking the **Remove** button next to a member, or promote additional team members to Team Manager, by clicking the option list below the member.

### Finding Teams

A listing of all `Teams` to which you belong is available on the **Teams** tab of your User Profile Page. You may leave any `Team` of which you are a member by clicking **Tools**>**Leave Team**.

You may search for Synapse `Teams` using the **Search All Teams** button on the **Teams** tab of your User Profile Page. You may also search `Teams` using the general search box in the header of each Synapse page by prefacing the search with **@** (e.g. @PCBC).

For `Teams` to which you do not belong, you may view the team members and contact information, as well as request to join the `Team` via the **Request to Join Team** button. You may also search among team members using the search box on the upper right side of the page.

### Communications and Project Permissions

Each `Team` has an email address which can be used to message the team members. This address is found on the team page. Each team member will be reached at the email address they have registered with Synapse.

You may use `Teams` to manage Sharing Settings on `Files`, `Folders` and `Projects`. From the **Share** button you may add `Teams` in addition to individuals. Each member of the `Team` will receive the **Sharing Setting** specified for the `Team`.

### Submitting to a Challenge as a Team

When participating in a Challenge, you may submit solutions as an individual or as a `Team`. The `Team` must be registered with the challenge, which can be done by clicking the **Register a Team** button, typically on the **Forming a Team** page on the challenge wiki. When submitting a `File` to a challenge from the Web Client, you will be given the option to submit the `File` as part of a `Team`. You will then be asked to select from the registered `Teams` of which you are a member, or register an existing `Team` with the challenge, and to verify which team members contributed to the solution. Note that only members who have already registered with the challenge may be selected.
