## Overview

`Wikis` are available in Synapse projects to provide a space to build narrative content to describe the research. 
Every project has a Wiki tab where you can build pages and a hierarchy of subpages as you would with any website. These pages can be reordered through the Edit Order button below the Wiki pages. `Wikis` can also be added to `Folders` and `Files` allowing additional content documentation. `Wikis`, whether they are under the Wiki tab or on a folder, are built in the same way and enables incorporation of highly customized content including, but not limited to: images, tables, code blocks, LaTeX formatted equations, and scholarly references. In addition, Synapse-specific widgets lets you embed dynamic content based on other resources stored in Synapse. 

## Starting, editing and deleting a Wiki


### Using the Synapse web portal
After creating a new project select the Wiki tab. Start a `Wiki` through the Tools menu by selecting the 'Edit Project Wiki' function. Content in this first `Wiki` becomes your `Project`'s home page. Go to the Tools menu to add subpages to your `Wiki`. These will appear as links on the left side of your home page (Image?). Adding a `Wiki` to a `Folder` or `File` is done in a similar manner by selecting 'Edit Folder/File Wiki'. Content added to a `Wiki` can be Previewed before Saving. Each version of a saved `Wiki` is visible under Wiki History where older versions can be restored. To delete a `Wiki` select 'Delete Wiki Page' under Tools.  

### Using R/Python (need someone to complete this)
{% tabs %} {% tab Command %}

{% highlight bash %} 
The command line client does not support the creation of Wiki content. We suggest using (to get to the webpage of the project) synapse onweb syn### where syn### is the Synapse Id of your created project. Then editing the Wiki using the web client. {% endhighlight %} {% endtab %}

{% tab Python %} {% highlight python %}
projWiki = Wiki(title='Data Summary', owner = myProj ) markdown = '''* Cell growth look normally distributed
There is evidence of inverse growth between these two cell lines ''' projWiki['markdown'] = markdown projWiki = syn.store(projWiki) 
{% endhighlight %} {% endtab %}

{% tab R %} {% highlight r %} library(synapseClient); 
placeholderText <- "* Cell growth look normally distributed\n* There is evidence of inverse growth between these two cell lines." wiki <- WikiPage(owner=myProject, title="Analysis summary", markdown=placeholderText) wiki <- synStore(wiki) 
{%endhighlight %} {% endtab %}

{% tab Web %} Select **Tools** then select **Edit Project/Folder/File wiki** {% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

## Governance
`Wiki` pages do not have `Conditions for Use` as a feature. Therefore, **do not** put any protected human data (`Controlled Data`) in Synapse `Wikis`. See the Synapse Data Use Procedure document for [details](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.synapse.org/governance/SageBionetworksSynapseTermsandConditionsofUse.pdf?v=4){:target="_blank"}.

## Wiki Features

### Markdown language
The layout and text of a `Wiki` can be customized using Wiki markdown language. A Formatting Guide is available within the Wiki editing window. For additional markdown functions see (need link). Useful markdown shortcuts are available as separate tools, including: heading, bold, italic, strike-through, code block, sub and superscript. 

### Attachments, links and tagging
Files, images and videos can be attached to a `Wiki`. This may be content on from the web, your desktop, or `Files` already uploaded to Synapse. Links can be added to content available from any source with a url or to a Synapse users profile through the Tag someone widget, or by typing @ - just enter the Synapse username in the dialog that appears.

### Additional Widgets

On the project Wiki page, go to 'Tools' and click on 'Edit Project Wiki'

See the 'Insert' list for the following widgets to customize your Wiki design.
